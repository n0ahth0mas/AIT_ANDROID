# AIT ANDROID
Android Projects I worked on while at AIT in my mobile software development course.

# PROJECT 1: MINESWEEPER

The goal of this first project was to create a basic implementation of Minesweeper using our introductory knowledge in Android Studio and Kotlin. The main specifications of this project were:
 1. learn the basics of Kotlin programming
 2. create Activities
 3. implement custom XML UI
 4. draw on custom views
 5. apply basic View components

 I was able to extend these specification to further build on my understading of the Android platform - in this project, I added additional images to the game interface and created a color changing gradient background as well.

# PROJECT 2: Shopping List

The goal of this second project was to create a more advanced Android application to further our understanding and to give us inspiration for future personal projects. The specifications of this project were to:
 1. create multiple activities
 2. use RecyclerView to display lists
 3. implement custom dialogs
 4. create splash animations
 5. introduct persistant data storage through the Room library

 This project allowed me to expand my understanding on data storage and SQL queries, which will help for future projets using Firebase and other APIs. This has also introduced me to animations, something which I am excited to utilize in other assignments and personal projects.
